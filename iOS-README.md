# SoundTouch iOS Build Configuration

## What's Been Set Up

I've configured your SoundTouch project for iOS builds with the following files:

### üìÅ Build Configuration Files
- `cmake/iOS.cmake` - iOS-specific CMake toolchain file
- `build-ios.sh` - Automated build script for macOS
- `iOS-Integration-Guide.md` - Complete integration guide with code examples

### üîß Configuration Features
- **Universal Library**: Builds for both iOS devices (arm64) and simulators (x86_64, arm64)
- **ARM NEON Optimizations**: Enabled for better performance on iOS devices
- **Static Library**: Creates `.a` files suitable for iOS projects
- **iOS 12.0+ Support**: Configured for modern iOS versions

## üöÄ How to Build for iOS

### Option 1: Automated Build (Recommended)
1. Copy this entire project to a **macOS machine** with Xcode installed
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder
3. Run these commands:
```bash
chmod +x build-ios.sh
./build-ios.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual CMake Build
```bash
mkdir build-ios && cd build-ios
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/iOS.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## üì¶ Build Output
After building, you'll find:
- `install-ios/universal/lib/libSoundTouch.a` - Universal static library
- `install-ios/universal/include/soundtouch/` - Header files

## üì± iOS Integration
See `iOS-Integration-Guide.md` for:
- Step-by-step Xcode integration
- Objective-C++ wrapper code
- Swift usage examples
- Build settings configuration

## ‚úÖ Ready to Use
Your SoundTouch library is now configured for iOS! The build process will create a universal static library that works on both iOS devices and simulators.

## üéØ Key Benefits
- **Cross-platform**: Same codebase works on Android (existing) and iOS (new)
- **Optimized**: ARM NEON SIMD instructions for better performance
- **Universal**: Single library file works on all iOS architectures
- **Modern**: Supports latest iOS versions and development practices
